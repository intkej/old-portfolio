            The name I got was Johannes, surname was Intke. Born in 6/13/2008 5:32 AM.
            Started playing video games almost the same second I started walking. First code
            language was JavaScript with node.js, and my first "big" coding project was completed in that language in early
            2020.
            In the beginning of 2021, started coding actively. And since that time, I have coded something every single
            day.
            If I go on a vacation away from home, I take my laptop with me, if I go spend night at hospital (annual
            routine),
            I take my laptop with me, if I go to a sleepover at my friend's place, guess what I'll do, I take my laptop with me.
            I can bravely say that I've spent half of my lifetime with computers and technology.
    
            <br><br>Currently making physical devices with Lua and electric knowledge, I'm using Infrared light and RF (radio frequency)
            <br><br>Okay, that was little bit of my technical life. I'm a nerd, but yes, I have been touching the grass in my lifetime too.
            I have spent hundreds of hours in skating and scooting (mostly scooting), my best achievement in scooting is when I did
            Triple Tailwhip -trick on a ramp at the local skatepark. Last time when I skated or scooted was in 2020.
